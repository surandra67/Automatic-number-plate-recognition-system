# Automatic-number-plate-recognition-system
o	A license number plate recognition system takes an image of a vehicle, detect number plate  and extract the registration number from the number plate.
o	The  system is built using OpenCV and OCR, a machine learning model build around TensorFlow.
o	To train the model, image dataset was made from two datasets from Kaggle, one containing images from different countries, different angles and the other having xml file corresponding to those images.

Steps to Follow:
- Dowlaod the number plate dataset from the kaggle eg (https://www.kaggle.com/code/gauravcodes/automatic-number-plate-recognition/input)
- Run the "Model Training.ipynb" file.
- then Run the ANPR  (main).ipynb file to make predictions.
